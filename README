DESCRIPTION
     Unifiedps displays information about running processes by wrapping and
     decorating the platform's native ps command in a unified way across
     different platforms, e.g. Mac OS X/Darwin, Linux, AIX, and HP-UX.

     As unifiedps supports multiple platforms, it displays only a selection
     of information about the processes which is available on all supported
     platforms. Currently, for each process, the process' id, the parent
     process' id, the user's name, the name of the controlling terminal, the
     process' cpu time, and the associated command and arguments will be
     shown.

     Unifiedps has a set of built-in options which do not correspond to the
     options of any platform's native ps command. All these built-in options
     start with two dashes. Additionally, unifiedps provides a small macro
     processor for defining user-defined options which may reflect options
     of a native ps command. User-defined options start with a single dash.

     Built-in options:

     --display-format <format>
          Selects the format to use for displaying the processes.

          Possible formats are list and tree. list selects a simple list
          format, while tree selects a format which displays a process'
          child processes in a tree-structured, hierarchical way.

          By default, the tree format is used.

     --display-indent <field>
          Indents the information of the given <field> according to the
          process' hierarchy. A <field>'s indentation-width is increased by
          one whitespace for each specified --display-indent option.

          Available <field>s are command and pid.

          This option is considerd by the tree display format only.

     --no-display-indent <field>
          Removes the indentation for the specified <field>. The <field>
          value all removes indentations for all fields.

     --display-header
     --no-display-header
          Does/Doesn't display a header line.

     --display-width <width>
          Specifies the number of columns to use for formatting the output.

          If -1 is specified as the <width>, unifiedps will use as many
          columns as necessary to display the processes' information.

          By default, the current window's width is used for formatting the
          output. The environment variable <COLUMNS> is used to determine
          the window's width. If this variable is not defined, 80 columns
          will be used.

     --mark <field> <operator> <value> [or <operator> <value> [or ...]]
          Marks all displayed processes which match the given criteria. If
          the --mark option is specified more than once then the criteria
          from all --mark options will be and'ed.

          Available <field>s are command, pid, tty, and user.

          Valid <operator>s are equals, contains, starts, ends and their
          negating counterparts nequals, ncontains, nstarts, and nends.
          Operators can be abbreviated with at least the first two
          characters, e.g. eq or co, and at least the first three characters
          for negating operators, e.g. neq or nco.

          The special <operator>s is and nis map to contains and ncontains
          for the command <field> and to equals and nequals for all other
          <field>s.

          For the tty <field>, no-tty is a special <value> for specifying
          that a controlling terminal does not exist.

          By default, the displayed processes of the current user are
          marked. This corresponds to specifying --mark user eq $USER on the
          command line.

     --no-mark <field>
          Removes all previously specified mark criteria for the given
          <field>. The <field> value all can be used to remove the mark
          criteria for all fields.

     --restrict <field> <operator> <value> [or <operator> <value> [or ...]]
          Restricts the displayed processes by the specified restriction
          criteria.

          The format of the option's arguments is equal to those of the
          --mark option.

          By default, only processes which belong to the current user and
          which are connected to a controlling terminal are displayed.

     --no-restrict <criterion>
          Removes all previously specified restriction criteria.

          The format of the option's arguments is equal to those of the
          --no-mark option.

     --include <relation>
          Includes all processes for display which are in the given
          <relation> to the selected processes.

          Possible <relation>s are parents and children.

          Includes are processed after restrictions, but includes qualify
          for marking.

     --no-include <relation>
          Removes all previously specified includes for the given type of
          <relation>. Use the special <relation> all to remove all includes.

     --platform <platform>
          Skips the auto-detection of the current platform and uses the
          supplied <platform> instead.

          Supported <platform>s are aix, darwin, freebsd, hpux, i5ospase,
          linux, macosx, and solaris.

     --stdin
          Reads the process list from STDIN instead of calling the
          platform's native ps command.

     --version
          Prints unifiedps' version information and exits.

     User-defined options:

     -<user-defined-option> [<argument1> [<argument2> ...]]
          Expands the user-defined option as defined in the user-specific
          configuration file ~/.unifiedpsrc.

          A definition of a user-defined option has the following format
          which must be specified within a single line:

          -<name> [<argument-names>] := <definition>

          where <name> is the name of the user-defined option,
          <argument-names> is an optional, whitespace-separated list of the
          option's argument names, and <definition> is the definition to
          which the option will be expanded by the macro processor. In the
          <definition>, an argument name 'a' can be referenced via '${a}'.
          During macro expansion, all argument names will be replaced by the
          concrete arguments which were specified at the command line.

          A user-defined option '-u <user>' which restricts the displayed
          processes to those which belong to the specified user can be
          defined as follows:

          -u user := --no-restrict user --restrict user eq ${user}

          A line which starts with a '#' is considered as a comment. All
          contigous comments in front of a user-defined option's definition
          are considered as the option's documentation.

     --no-restrict user
